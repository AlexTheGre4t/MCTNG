Hi! Thanks for playing Minecraft: The Next Generation! This pack has been heavily modified to give the game a more sandbox feel. Iâ€™d like to thank asie for coming up with the idea and starting the concept. You will notice a lot of normal dangers are a lot less common, with more passive dangers put in place. 

Such as a drastic decrease in hostile mobs, extremely dark nights, and the removal of other dimensions, such as the Nether and End. Food is a lot less of a worry now too, it will take you more than twice the time to lose all hunger. Though a variety of food is needed to keep your hunger levels high.
